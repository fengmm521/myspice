   Original this function is named AlmostEqual2sComplement but we leave it to AlmostEqualUlps
   and can leave the code (measure.c, dctran.c) unchanged. The transformation to the 2's complement
   prevent problems around 0.0. 
   One Ulp is equivalent to a maxRelativeError of between 1/4,000,000,000,000,000 and 1/8,000,000,000,000,000.
   Practical: 3 < maxUlps < some hundred's (or thousand's) - depending on numerical requirements.
